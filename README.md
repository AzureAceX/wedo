The github main branch was designed for local spring/java and SQL deployment, but the application was designed from the start for the heroku environment along with POSTGRES DB as is seen in the heroku branch.

The aim was to design two sub versions of the application, with the main view being developed using more manual means, and the alt view was to incorporate plugins like tabulator and a theme for a UI centric approach. Ultimately, using this chance to try out heroku and postgress DB for the first time resulted in a bit of a learning curve in the project cycle. Though I addressed all issues that came up, it ended up taking longer than expected. The application stands as a CRUD-esque to do list, with the added functionality of addressing parent-child relationships when updating status.

I hope the application can showcase my ability to address various kind of setbacks in a development sprint and persistently resolve them. 
Similarly, the application follows the MVC architecture on both the front and back end of the app, with controllers making use of services for more advanced functionality. I originally designed the app with a much larger scale in mind, and features that I have yet to implement.

I'll be continually updating this repo for the personal reason of wanting to actualize my vision of it. 
Thank you for reading thus far.
Regards.
